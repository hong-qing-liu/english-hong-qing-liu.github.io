    <h1>Profile</h1>
    <p>Hongqing Liu received his Ph.D. in Electronic Engineering from City University of Hong Kong in 2009. From 2009 to 2013, he worked as a researcher at the Underwater Acoustics Laboratory, National University of Singapore. In 2013, he joined the School of Communication Engineering at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, where he currently serves as a professor and doctoral supervisor. Professor Liu has long been engaged in multidisciplinary R&D work in communications, signal processing, and speech. He has published over 200 SCI/EI-indexed academic papers in high-level international journals such as IEEE Trans. Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Trans. Image Processing, IEEE Trans. Signal Processing, IEEE Trans. Communications, IEEE Trans. Information Theory, and The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, as well as in prestigious international conferences like IEEE ICASSP, INTERSPEECH, and ICLR. In the past three years, he has been granted one PCT international patent and four national invention patents. In 2009, he received the First Prize of Shaanxi Higher Education Science and Technology Award (No. 06C8) and the Second Prize of Shaanxi Science and Technology Progress Award (No. 06-2-010-R9). In 2016, he received the Best Paper Award at the IEEE DSP conference, and he has been recognized as an outstanding reviewer for journals such as SP and DSP. He is a senior member of IEEE, a high-level talent in Chongqing, and a Chongqing talent. Professor Liu's current research focuses on statistical signal processing, with an emphasis on speech signal processing.</p>
